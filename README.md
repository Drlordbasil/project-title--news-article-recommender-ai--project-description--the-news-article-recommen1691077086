# News Article Recommender AI

The News Article Recommender AI is an autonomous Python program that utilizes web scraping techniques, specifically the Beautiful Soup library, to gather the latest news articles from various online sources. The program then employs advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to analyze the content of these articles and generate personalized recommendations based on a user's interests and preferences.

## Features

1. **Web Scraping:** The program uses the Beautiful Soup library to scrape news articles from popular news websites. It dynamically fetches the latest articles each time it runs, ensuring users have access to up-to-date information.

2. **Content Analysis:** The AI leverages NLP techniques to process and understand the content of the scraped articles. It extracts relevant keywords, detects sentiment, and categorizes articles based on topics.

3. **User Profile Creation:** Users can create personalized profiles within the program, where they specify their preferences and areas of interest. The AI learns from these preferences to generate more accurate and tailored recommendations.

4. **Recommendation Engine:** The program employs machine learning algorithms to match user preferences with the analyzed article content. It recommends articles based on topic relevance, sentiment alignment, and user history.

5. **Real-time Notifications:** Users can choose to receive real-time notifications or digest emails with the latest news articles that match their preferences. This keeps users informed and engaged with topics of interest.

6. **Saved Articles:** Users can save articles of interest within the program for later reference. This feature allows them to create curated reading lists and revisit articles at their convenience.

7. **Feedback System:** The program includes a feedback system where users can rate and provide feedback on recommended articles. This feedback loop helps the AI continuously improve the accuracy of its recommendations.

8. **Exploratory Article Search:** Users can utilize the program to search for articles on specific topics of interest. The AI finds the most relevant articles from the web and presents them to the user.

## Technical Implementation

The project will be implemented using the following Python libraries and techniques:

- **Web Scraping:** The program will utilize the Beautiful Soup library to scrape news articles from popular news websites. It will make HTTP requests to the websites, parse the HTML content, and extract relevant information such as headline and summary.

- **Data Extraction and Analysis:** The NLTK library will be used for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, stop words removal, stemming, and sentiment analysis. These techniques will help analyze the content of the scraped articles and extract meaningful features.

- **Machine Learning:** The program will employ machine learning algorithms to match user preferences with the analyzed article content. Techniques such as cosine similarity and collaborative filtering can be used to enhance the recommendation engine's accuracy.

- **Data Storage:** The program can store user profiles, saved articles, and other relevant data in a database or in-memory data structures.

- **Real-time Notifications:** APIs for email services can be used to send real-time notifications or digest emails to users based on their preferences and the availability of new articles.
